    The :class:`DxlClient` class is responsible for all communication with the Data Exchange Layer (DXL)
    fabric (it can be thought of as the "main" class). All other classes exist to support the functionality
    provided by the client.

    The following example demonstrates the configuration of a :class:`DxlClient` instance and
    connecting it to the fabric:

    .. code-block:: python

        from dxlclient.broker import Broker
        from dxlclient.client import DxlClient
        from dxlclient.client_config import DxlClientConfig

        # Create the client configuration
        config = DxlClientConfig(
            broker_ca_bundle="c:\\\\certs\\\\brokercerts.crt",
            cert_file="c:\\\\certs\\\\client.crt",
            private_key="c:\\\\certs\\\\client.key",
            brokers=[Broker.parse("ssl://192.168.189.12")])

        # Create the DXL client
        with DxlClient(config) as dxl_client:

            # Connect to the fabric
            dxl_client.connect()

    **NOTE:** The preferred way to construct the client is via the Python "with" statement as shown above. The "with"
    statement ensures that resources associated with the client are properly cleaned up when the block is exited.

    The following modules support the client:

    - :mod:`dxlclient.client_config` : See this module for information on configuring the :class:`DxlClient`
    - :mod:`dxlclient.message` : See this module for information on the different types of messages that can be
      exchanged over the DXL fabric
    - :mod:`dxlclient.callbacks` : See this module for information on registering "callbacks" that are used to
      receive messages via the :class:`DxlClient`. This module also includes an example that demonstrate how to
      send :class:`dxlclient.message.Event` messages.
    - :mod:`dxlclient.service` : See this module for information on registering "services" with the DXL fabric.
      This module also includes an example that demonstrates how to invoke a DXL service via the :class:`DxlClient`.
