Samples Configuration
=====================

Prior to running any of the examples, you must complete the following:

* Install the Python SDK (:doc:`installation`)
* Provision the client to use with the samples (:doc:`provisioningoverview`)

  The ``dxlclient.config`` file located in the ``sample`` sub-directory of the Python DXL SDK
  must be populated.

  `NOTE:` If :ref:`Command Line Interface (CLI) <basiccliprovisioning>` provisioning is being performed,
  specify the ``sample`` directory as the output location for the provisioning operation.
